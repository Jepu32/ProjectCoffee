            <h2><strong>Different types of coffees</strong></h2>

            <h3>Filtered Coffee</h3>
            <p>Filtered coffee is the standard of normal coffee</p>

            <h3>Espresso</h3>
            <p>To make an espresso, shoot boiling water under high pressure through finely ground up coffee beans and then pour into a tiny mug. Espressos are the purest coffee experience you can get. The espresso is the foundation and the most important part to every espresso based drink. </p>

            <h3>Caffé Americano</h3>
            <p>You can make this type of coffee quite simply by adding hot water to a shot of espresso coffee. It has been said that American soldiers during the Second World War would make this type of coffee to make their beverages last longer. It was then (apparently) adopted by American baristas after the war.</p>

            <h3>Cappuccino</h3>
            <p>Possibly the most popular type of coffee in the world, a cappuccino consists of three layers. The first is a shot of espresso, then a shot of steamed milk, and a layer of frothed, foamy milk. This final layer can also be topped with chocolate shavings or powder.</p>

            <h3>Café Latte (or Café au lait)</h3>
            <p>A café latte, or “latte” for short, is an espresso based drink with steamed milk and micro-foam added to the coffee. This coffee is much sweeter compared to an espresso due to the steamed milk.</p>

            <h3>Macchiato (also known as a Piccolo Latte)</h3>
            <p>A macchiato is a shot of espresso which is then topped off with foamed milk dashed directly into the cup.  Although it may sound similar to a cappuccino, it’s usually stronger.</p>
